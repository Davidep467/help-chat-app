# help-chat-app

<ins>Description:</ins>

Full-stack chat app for customer support (typically used by airline companies). 

You can login as a "User" (someone who is looking for help but can't find the answer on the Help Center so he/she clicks on the "Chat with an operator" button to start a chat with an agent) or as an "Operator" who will have access to all the started chats and can reply to different customers at the same time.

Both Users and Operators can upload and download images and attachments.

You can log in as a client and as an Operator at the same time to see it working.
